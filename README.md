# Sticky Pull Request Comment

Create a comment on a pull request, if it exists update that comment.
This library runs with GitHub Actions. If you feel that the example grammar below is not friendly enough, we recommend reading [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) first.

## Usage

### Basic

You need to add permissions for this tool:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
```

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  message: |
    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>
```

### Keep more than one comment

In some cases, different actions may require different comments. The header allows you to maintain comments independently.

````yaml
release:
  ...
  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
    with:
      header: release
      message: |
        Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>

test:
  ...
  - name: Run Test
    run: |
      EOF=$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=15 count=1 status=none | base64)
      {
        echo "TEST_RESULT<<$EOF"
        rake test
        echo "$EOF"
      } >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
    with:
      header: test
      message: |
        ```
        ${{ env.TEST_RESULT }}
        ```
````

### Append after comment every time it runs

````yaml
test:
  ...
  - name: Run Test
    run: |
      EOF=$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=15 count=1 status=none | base64)
      {
        echo "TEST_RESULT<<$EOF"
        rake test
        echo "$EOF"
      } >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
    with:
      append: true
      message: |
        Test with ${{ github.sha }}.
        ```
        ${{ env.TEST_RESULT }}
        ```
````

### Comment from push

If for some reason, triggering on pr is not possible, you can use push.

```yaml
- uses: jwalton/gh-find-current-pr@v1
  id: finder
- uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  with:
    number: ${{ steps.finder.outputs.pr }}
    message: |
      Test ${{ github.sha }} ended successfully.
      This message is from a push.
```

### Read comment from a file

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  path: path-to-comment-contents.txt
```

### Delete the previous comment and add a comment at the end

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  recreate: true
  message: |
    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>
```

### Delete previous comment

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  header: <same-header-as-the-step-that-added-the-comment>
  delete: true
```

### Hide the previous comment and add a comment at the end

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  hide_and_recreate: true
  hide_classify: "OUTDATED"
  message: |
    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>
```

### Hide previous comment

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  header: <same-header-as-the-step-that-added-the-comment>
  hide: true
  hide_classify: "OUTDATED"
```

### Error: Resource not accessible by integration

This tool requires write permission, and that message means the requester does not have enough permission.
Recently, GitHub sets permissions conservatively for newly created repositories. If it's a newly created repository, check your Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions, and make sure to enable read and write permissions.

Then, you can specify permissions for the job like this:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
```

If your repository is private, setting this setting removes all default permissions on your workflow, so for the actions/checkout step to work which is highly common, you will also need the `contents` permissions set.
Otherwise you will get an error such as "fatal: repository *** not found"

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read
```

For more detailed information about permissions, you can read from the link below:
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs>

## Inputs

### `header`

### `number`

**Optional** Pull request number for push event. Note that this has a **lower priority** than the number of a pull_request event.

### `owner`

**Optional** Another repository owner, If not set, the current repository owner is used by default. Note that when you trying changing a repo, be aware that `GITHUB_TOKEN` should also have permission for that repository.

### `repo`

**Optional** Another repository name. Of limited use on GitHub enterprise. If not set, the current repository is used by default. Note that when you trying changing a repo, be aware that `GITHUB_TOKEN` should also have permission for that repository.

### `ignore_empty`

**Optional** By default this is `false`. If set to `true`, no comment will be posted if the comment body is empty. Note that enabling this will prevent comment hiding & deletion from working when the body is empty.

**Optional** By default this is `false`. If set to `true`, recreating or updating a comment will be skipped if the new message is identical to the current message.

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`
