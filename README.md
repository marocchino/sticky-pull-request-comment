# Sticky Pull Request Comment

Create comment on pull request, if exists update that comment.
This library runs with GitHub Actions. If you feel that the example grammar below is not friendly enough, we recommend reading [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) first.

## Usage

### Basic

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  message: |
    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>
```

### Keep more than one comment

In some cases, different actions may require different comments. The header allows you to maintain comments independently.

```yaml
release:
  ...
  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    header: release
    message: |
      Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>

test:
  ...
  - name: Run Test
  id: test
  run: |
    OUTPUT=$(rake test)
    OUTPUT="${OUTPUT//'%'/'%25'}‚Äã„Äê7,6 m„Äë"
    OUTPUT="${OUTPUT//$'\n'/'%0A'}"
    OUTPUT="${OUTPUT//$'\r'/'%0D'}"
    echo "::set-output name=result::$OUTPUT"
  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    header: test
    message: |
      ```
      ${{ steps.test.outputs.result }}
      ```
```

### Append after comment every time it runs

```yaml
test:
  ...
  - name: Run Test
  id: test
  run: |
    OUTPUT=$(rake test)
    OUTPUT="${OUTPUT//'%'/'%25'}‚Äã„Äê7,6 m„Äë"
    OUTPUT="${OUTPUT//$'\n'/'%0A'}"
    OUTPUT="${OUTPUT//$'\r'/'%0D'}"
    echo "::set-output name=result::$OUTPUT"
  - uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    append: true
    message: |
      Test with ${{ github.sha }}.
      ```
      ${{ steps.test.outputs.result }}
      ```
```

### Comment from push

If for some reason, triggering on pr is not possible, you can use push.

```yaml
- uses: jwalton/gh-find-current-pr@v1
id: finder
with:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
- uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  number: ${{ steps.finder.outputs.pr }}
  message: |
    Test ${{ github.sha }} is successfully ended.
    This is message from push.
```

### Read comment from a file

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  path: path-to-comment-contents.txt
```

### Delete previous commit and add comment at bottom

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  recreate: true
  message: |
    Release ${{ github.sha }} to <https://pr-${{ github.event.number }}.example.com>
```

### Delete previous comment

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  delete: true
```
